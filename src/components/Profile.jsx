                        Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Abhishek Navgan, a developer with a
                        not-so-secret obsession with tech. I'm currently
                        pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications degree
                        at TMV Pune, where I spend most of my time coding,
                        diving into development, and attending lectures that
                        don't always capture my interest.
                        I love creating websites and software,
                        especially with the MERN stack â€” because, you know,
                        who doesn't like to hate JavaScript, right?
                        <br /> <br />
                        While I'm mostly focused on coding, I've got
                        a soft spot for web design (even if I'm not
                        actively chasing that rabbit hole right now,
                        one day I definitely will). I'm a big fan
                        of cool cars, gaming, computers, and 'gaming
                        computers' â€” because, why not have more than
                        one expensive hobby, right?
                        <br /> <br />
                        And yeah, I have a bit of a perfectionist streak
                        â€” I can't resist tweaking things until they feel
                        just right... or until I've spent way too much
                        time on them (like this website ðŸ˜‰).
